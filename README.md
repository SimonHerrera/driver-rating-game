# Driver Rating Game

Deployed site -> [Driver Rating Game](https://simonherrera.github.io/driver-rating-game/#/)

Think you are a good driver? Register and see what the drivers you share the road with think. Ever want to communicate with the driver of the car that just cut you off? Now you can! The Driver Rating Game allows users to track license plates by state and number even if that plate is not attached to a registered user. When a driver registers their plate if it matches an existing one it is then paired to that driver allowing them to see exactly where they stand.

To get help within the app, click 'Help' to read up on the game itself.

If you would like to delete your account, click on the 'Delete Account' button to proceed. You should see a warning about stating that you are about to delete your account.

* If you delete your account the plate and messages associated to your personal information will still remain in the database. None of your personal information will link that plate to your name. It is by design that the plate and messages remain, your fellow drivers should know how the car tied to that plate conducts itself on the road.
